                <h2>Adesayo M.</h2>
                <h3>Medical information specialist and Techie in progress</h3>
                <p>
                My mission is to make a significant contribution to healthcare innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa.
                <br><br>
                I'm highly passionate about transforming health systems and clinical research through technology. With a background in pharmacology and experience in the pharmaceutical industry, my goal is to merge my 
                expertise in pharma with innovative technological solutions to streamline and advance clinical research, produce better patient outcomes and optimize healthcare delivery, and improve quality of life.
                <br><br>
                I hope to bring a patient-first approach to my work by bridging the gap between high-level research and practical usage, while maintaining the safety, integrity and accuracy of research and post drug marketing data.

                <h2>Watch a Random Video</h2>
                <p>This is a random video of someone typing on a keyboard, but I'm in awe of the lighting and the mood in the picture.
                <br><br>
                It's fascinating how lighting changes the mood in a video. It could give life to a footage, and evoke emotions that words would never be able to do. 
                
                <br><br>
                Each ray, shade, and shade contrast acts just like a stroke of the brush, painting 
                the very essence of the moment and leaving me in amazement at the artistry of every single captured frame.
                <br><br>
                Light plays with shadows to bring depth, emotion, and atmosphere to even the most trivial scenes. I love the usage of warm lighting to set  a cozy, homey scene, and tell a story without words.
